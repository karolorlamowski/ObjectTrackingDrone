The position is specified in terms of the NED (North East Down) relative to the Home location.

WARNING: The "D" in NED means "Down". Using a positive D value will drive the vehicle into the ground!

The code sleeps for a time (DURATION) to give the vehicle time to reach each position (rather than 
sending commands based on proximity).
