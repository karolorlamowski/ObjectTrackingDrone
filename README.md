# Object_Tracking_Drone
Drone w/ camera gimbal controlled by Pixhawk and Raspberry Pi running OpenCV

The goal of this project is to use the MavLnk protocol and OpenCV to allow object detection and tracking on a drone controlled by a pixhawk flight controller.

This project assumes that you already have a XXXX-copter configured using [QGroundControl software](http://qgroundcontrol.com/) which is able to fly using the [stabilized flight mode](http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/flight-modes.html)
