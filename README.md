# Object_Tracking_Drone

for the time being all of this is for my own personal reference while putting together a properly organized project. feel free to reach out if you have questions abotu the project.

Drone w/ camera gimbal controlled by Pixhawk and Raspberry Pi running OpenCV

The goal of this project is to use the MavLnk protocol and OpenCV to allow object detection and tracking on a drone controlled by a pixhawk flight controller.

This project assumes that you already have a XXXX-copter configured using [QGroundControl software](http://qgroundcontrol.com/) which is able to fly using the [stabilized flight mode](http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/flight-modes.html)

put in thanks to: pyimagesearch and mjrovai for tutorials on object tracking and rpi io stuff

mention using python -m pip for installing files through python2.7, 3.8 etc.

go into programming flight modes for the pixhawk...
